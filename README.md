# Dataset Sampling Methods Tutorial

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook tutorial demonstrating different sampling methods for dataset sampling: random, stratified, systematic, and cluster sampling. 

## Overview

Sampling methods are essential in statistics and data analysis to draw conclusions about a population based on a subset of data. This tutorial provides an overview of four common sampling methods and demonstrates how to implement them using Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Contents

- **`sampling.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the tutorial code and explanations for each sampling method.
- **`datasets/`**: Directory containing sample datasets used in the tutorial.
  
## Getting Started

To run the tutorial notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running `jupyter notebook` in the terminal.
5. Open the `sampling.ipynb` notebook.
6. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to understand and execute each sampling method.

## Sampling Methods Covered

1. **Random Sampling**: Selecting observations randomly from the dataset.
2. **Systematic Sampling**: Selecting every kth item from the dataset after a random start.
3. **Stratified Sampling**: Dividing the population into homogeneous groups (strata) and then taking a random sample from each group.
4. **Cluster Sampling**: Dividing the population into clusters, then randomly selecting some clusters and sampling all observations within those clusters.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
